# 30-Day Social Campaign Plan (Kickstart Edition)

**Platforms:** Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram
**Frequency:** 3 posts per day per platform
**Duration:** 30 days

### Posting Schedule Example (Day 1)
| Time      | Platform   | Link/Topic                                      | Suggested Image                                      |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 9:00 AM   | Facebook   | School of Cloud & DevOps                        | public/course_og_images/advanced-ansible-automation-iac.png |
| 12:00 PM  | LinkedIn   | Advanced SEO Mastery                            | public/course_og_images/advanced-seo-rank-1-on-google.png   |

Repeat for all platforms, rotating links and images. Use course, school, and service links below. For each post, use a unique image from public/course_og_images or public/og-images (see directory listing for options).

### Suggested Images
- For course links: Use matching image from public/course_og_images (e.g., advanced-seo-rank-1-on-google.png)
- For school links: Use a relevant course image or a general school image from public/og-images
- For service links: Use matching image from public/og-images (e.g., business-plan-and-logo-design.jpg)

### Campaign Tips for Maximum Results
1. **Vary Content:** Mix course, school, and service posts. Use testimonials, success stories, and tips.
2. **Use Hashtags:** #Hexadigitall #DigitalSkills #CareerGrowth #LearnTech #BusinessSuccess
3. **Engage:** Ask questions, run polls, and encourage comments.
4. **Visuals:** Always use a high-quality, relevant image. Add short video clips if possible.
5. **Track Performance:** Use UTM links and analytics to monitor engagement and adjust strategy.
6. **Cross-Promote:** Share posts across platforms and in relevant groups/communities.
7. **Call to Action:** Always include a clear CTA (e.g., "Enroll now!", "Learn more!", "Share with friends!")
8. **Pin Key Posts:** Pin important announcements or offers for visibility.
9. **Leverage Stories/Reels:** Use Instagram/Facebook stories and reels for extra reach.
10. **Weekly Themes:** E.g., "Cloud Week", "AI Week", "Design Week"—focus posts for 7 days on a theme.
