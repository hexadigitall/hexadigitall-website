## Message Option 3: Problem-Solution

```
Hi there! 👋

I hope this message finds you well!

I'm reaching out because we help fashion brands solve common challenges like:

❌ Managing orders through DMs and comments (gets overwhelming!)
❌ Payment tracking issues
❌ Customers asking "How do I buy?" on every post
❌ Limited selling hours (only when you're online)

Sound familiar? 🤔

We can help with a professional e-commerce platform that:

✅ Lets customers shop 24/7 (even while you sleep!)
✅ Automatically processes payments
✅ Sends order confirmations and receipts
✅ Tracks inventory for you
✅ Shows you sales reports and best sellers
✅ Makes products easy to share on social media

We've prepared a detailed proposal specifically for Jhema Wears that covers:
- Features & functionality
- Three pricing tiers (₦2.5M - ₦6.5M)
- Timeline (8-12 weeks)
- Training & support
- Return on investment

Would you like me to send it? I can share it here or via email, whatever works best for you!

Or if you'd prefer, we can hop on a 15-minute video call and I can walk you through it.

What do you think? 😊

Looking forward to your reply!
