# Instagram DM Template for Jhema Wears

## Important Note About Instagram

Instagram DMs are **more personal and visual** than other platforms. Keep messages:
- Short and casual
- Visually engaging (use emojis strategically)
- Mobile-optimized (most people check Instagram on phones)
- Authentic and genuine

**Key Constraint:** Instagram has stricter limits on business messages from accounts you don't follow. Build engagement first!

---

## Pre-Message Strategy

### Step 1: Engage Authentically (1-2 days before DM)

**Like and comment on 3-5 recent posts:**

Example Comments:
```
"This color combination is 🔥🔥🔥"

"Absolutely love this piece! The detail work is stunning ✨"

"Your styling is always on point! 😍"

"Been following your journey—your growth is inspiring! 💯"
```

### Step 2: View Their Stories

- React to stories with relevant emojis
- Reply to story questions
- Engage with polls/quizzes if they have any

### Step 3: Now Send DM

After you've engaged authentically, they're more likely to see and respond to your DM!

## Message Option 3: Value-First

Hey! 👋

Obsessed with your fashion sense! 😍

Real talk: Most fashion brands don't know that when they share product links, they could show:

Instead of just... a link 😅

We can set that up for you + build a full online store!

Interested? I can send details 📬

No hard sell, just thought it might help! ✨

## What to Avoid on Instagram

❌ **Long paragraphs** - Instagram DMs are for quick convos
❌ **Too formal** - Keep it casual and authentic
❌ **Generic messages** - They get hundreds daily
❌ **Immediate pitch** - Build rapport first
❌ **Multiple messages at once** - Looks spammy
❌ **Sending without engagement** - Engage with content first
❌ **Business-y language** - Keep it conversational

---

## Video DM Script (If You Want to Stand Out)

Record a 15-30 second video showing:

1. **Your face** (builds trust)
2. **Quick intro** - "Hey Jhema Wears, I'm [Name]!"
3. **Compliment** - "Love your pieces, especially [item]"
4. **Value prop** - "We build websites for fashion brands"
5. **CTA** - "Would love to work with you! DM me back?"

**Why Video Works:**
- 85% higher open rate than text
- More memorable
- Shows you're real
- Builds instant rapport

## Instagram Story Template

### Create an engaging story to share:

**Slide 1:**
