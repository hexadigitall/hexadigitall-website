## 💬 Response Handling Scripts

### "It's too expensive"
**Response:**
> "I completely understand budget is important. The Kickstarter package at ₦300k/month actually costs less than hiring a junior social media manager (₦150k-₦200k salary + benefits), but you get a senior strategist + professional editor.

> Alternatively, the Blueprint package (₦250k one-time) gives you all the tools and training to run it in-house. Which approach interests you more?"

---

### "We're already doing social media in-house"
**Response:**
> "That's great that you're already active! The difference with our packages is the strategic layer—we bring:
> - Competitor analysis so you stay ahead
> - Algorithm optimization (why some Reels go viral and others don't)
> - Professional editing (lighting, color grading, transitions)
> - Ad expertise that prevents wasting ₦100k+ on poorly set up campaigns

> Many of our clients were posting regularly but not seeing sales growth. We fix that. Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore a hybrid approach?"

---

### "Can we start with a trial month?"
**Response:**
> "Absolutely! The Kickstarter package is perfect for testing the waters—it's our entry-level monthly retainer at ₦300k.

> However, if you want to see real traction fast, I'd recommend the Diva Takeover for one month during this peak season. The combination of content + influencers + ads creates a multiplier effect that justifies the investment.

> Which sounds better for your current goals?"

---

### "What makes you different from other agencies?"
**Response:**
> "Three things:
> 1. **Fashion-Specific Expertise:** We've worked exclusively with fashion/lifestyle brands, so we understand your customer psychology and buying triggers.
> 2. **No Intern Work:** You get senior editors and strategists—not junior staff learning on your dime.
> 3. **Results-Focused:** We track DM inquiries, website clicks, and actual sales—not just vanity metrics like likes.

> Most agencies create content. We create content that converts. Want to see our past work?"

---

### "We need to think about it"
**Response:**
> "Of course! Take all the time you need. While you're considering it, can I ask:
> - Which package appealed to you most?
> - Is there any specific concern or question I can address to help with your decision?
> - What's your timeline for making a decision?

> I want to make sure you have all the info you need. Also, if timing is a concern, I can hold a spot for you with a small deposit."
