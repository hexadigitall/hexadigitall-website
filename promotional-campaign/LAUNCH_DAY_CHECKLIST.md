## CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If: Reach is too low (< 80k by 8 PM)
**Action:** 
1. Check if posts are live (screenshots)
2. Analyze copy: Are people clicking? (Check CTR)
3. If CTR is low (< 1%): Copy isn't resonating → Test different angle
4. If CTR is high but reach is low: Algorithm suppression → Change posting times, try Reels instead of feed posts
5. Extra posts: Run 1 bonus post at 9 PM with proven winning angle

### If: Email open rate is low (< 15%)
**Action:**
1. Subject line might be weak → Activate A/B variant immediately
2. Send time might be off → Test 2-hour shifts tomorrow
3. List might be cold → Add more recent/engaged subscribers to next send

### If: Sales aren't converting DMs to calls (< 3 bookings)
**Action:**
1. Review CRM: Did leads get follow-up?
2. Check Calendly link: Is it working?
3. Sales pitch: Too salesy? Not urgent enough?
4. Offer: Add urgency ("Last 3 consultation slots this week") to booking link

### If: Platform goes down (Facebook/Instagram/Twitter outage)
**Action:**
1. Pause posts to that platform (no point broadcasting to nothing)
2. Redirect team: Focus on working platforms
3. When platform recovers: Repost the queued content immediately
4. Alert campaign manager: May affect daily metrics
