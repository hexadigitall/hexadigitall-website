---

## Decision Framework (The Traffic Light System)

### Green Light: Keep Doing (CTR > 3%, Engagement > 3%, Lead Cost < ₦3,000)
**Action:** Scale immediately
- Increase posting frequency (+1 extra post/week)
- Boost with ad budget (if available)
- Feature in internal case study
- Lock in copy + send time for future

**Example:**
```
❌ BEFORE: Web + Lagos + Instagram, Authority angle, 1 PM posting
✅ NOW: 4.6% CTR, 12 leads from 8 posts (4 leads/post)
✅ ACTION: Post 2x/day on this combo, boost with ₦5k budget, use testimonial from leads
```

---

### Yellow Light: Monitor & Test (CTR 1–3%, Engagement 2–3%, Lead Cost ₦3–5k)
**Action:** Test modifications before scaling or pausing

**Modification order (try in sequence):**
1. **Copy angle:** Swap Authority → Urgency → Speed → Proof
2. **Send time:** Shift +/- 2 hours
3. **Platform:** Move to sister platform (e.g., IG Reels instead of Feed post)
4. **City:** Try different city with same service
5. **Service:** Swap to related service (e.g., Web → Portfolio)

**Example:**
```
⚠️ BEFORE: Business Plans + Calabar + Twitter, Authority angle, 12 PM posting, 1.2% CTR
⚠️ ACTION (Week 1): Test Urgency angle, same time
⚠️ ACTION (Week 2): If still < 2%, shift to 3 PM + test Proof angle
⚠️ ACTION (Week 3): If still < 2%, pause and reallocate budget to Green Light combos
```

---

### Red Light: Pivot or Pause (CTR < 1%, Engagement < 2%, Lead Cost > ₦7,000)
**Action:** Pause immediately + reassign resources OR pivot one critical variable

**Decision tree:**
```
Red light? →
  Was this service/city ever tested before? 
    YES → Pause + reallocate budget to performer
    NO → Test once more with different angle/time/platform, then pause if no improvement
```

**Example:**
```
❌ BEFORE: E-Commerce + Kano + WhatsApp, Authority angle, 9 AM posting, 0.3% CTR, 1 lead from 1,200 impressions
❌ ACTION: This is a completely cold combo. Pause WhatsApp for this service/city.
❌ REALLOCATE: Move Kano budget to Web + Kano (proven performer, 2.7% CTR) + test 1 more angle
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Low Email Open Rates (< 20%)
**Mitigation:**
- A/B test subject lines every email (lock in winners)
- Adjust send times based on platform performance
- Segment by city (personalized content increases opens 26%)
- Fallback: If opens < 20% after 2 weeks, increase reply rate incentives (e.g., "Reply YES for free consultation")

### Risk 2: High Lead Cost (> ₦5,000)
**Mitigation:**
- Identify underperforming platforms early (Twitter often highest CAC)
- Reallocate budget to Green Light combos
- Test organic + paid mix (organic reach 30%, paid 70%)
- Fallback: Pause low-performing cities/services, focus on top 3

### Risk 3: Low Sales Conversion (< 10% of calls → close)
**Mitigation:**
- Sales to review demo + pitch (may need adjustment)
- Email qualification improved (pre-qualify leads before call)
- Offer adjustment (e.g., payment plans if objection is price)
- Fallback: Extend email nurture sequence to 10 days (instead of 7)

### Risk 4: Platform Algorithm Changes (reach drops suddenly)
**Mitigation:**
- Monitor reach daily (flag if > 30% drop)
- Have 2–3 alternate copy angles ready to deploy
- Test new platforms proactively (TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest)
- Fallback: Shift to paid ads (budget permitting) to stabilize reach

### Risk 5: Team Burnout (too many posts/follow-ups)
**Mitigation:**
- Start with 1–2 posts/platform/day (not 3)
- Use scheduling tools (Buffer, Later) to batch create
- Rotate team roles weekly (don't let one person do all social)
- Fallback: Reduce to 3x/week posting instead of daily if needed

```
Revenue from campaign: ₦20M
Cost of campaign (social + email + ads): ₦500k
Cost of team time (4 people × 60 days): ₦800k
Total investment: ₦1.3M

ROI = (Revenue - Costs) / Costs × 100
ROI = (₦20M - ₦1.3M) / ₦1.3M × 100
ROI = 1,438%

This is a successful campaign. Scale it.
```
