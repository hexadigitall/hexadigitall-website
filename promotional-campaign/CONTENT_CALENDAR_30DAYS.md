## Notes & Adjustments

- **Feedback loop**: If a post underperforms (<2% engagement), pivot the copy next rotation (same service/city).
- **Holidays**: Dec 25, Jan 1 = lower engagement. Shift to mid-week emphasis.
- **Trending moments**: If a city news event happens (good or bad), tie a service post to it for relevance.
- **Quick wins**: Monitor which service/city combos are hottest; double down on top performers.
