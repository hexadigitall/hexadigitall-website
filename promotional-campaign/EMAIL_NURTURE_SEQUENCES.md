## Email 1: Welcome + Problem Hook (Day 0 — Immediate)

### Body Template

Hi {FirstName},

Thanks for checking out our website services. 👋

I'm guessing you're either:
1. Tired of waiting 3 months (and ₦500k+) for a website
2. Running a website that doesn't make sales
3. Or both

Here's the truth: A website is your 24/7 salesperson.

If it's not making you money, it's costing you money.

---

**Here's what most businesses get wrong:**
- They hire agencies that take forever
- They pay too much upfront
- Their site looks pretty but doesn't convert

**Here's what we do different:**
✅ 14-day turnaround (not 14 weeks)
✅ ₦299,000 flat (no hidden fees)
✅ Mobile-first + conversion-optimized
✅ Paystack checkout built in

---

**Next step:** Reply to this email or book a 15-min consultation below.

## Email 2: Social Proof + Authority (Day 1)

### Subject Lines (Test A/B)
- A: "One {City} client went from ₦0 to ₦500k/month"
- B: "{FirstName}, see what {City} businesses are doing"
- C: "Why 47 {City} brands chose us this year"

### Body Template

```
Hi {FirstName},

Yesterday I told you about our website services.

Today, I want to show you proof.

---

**One of our {City} clients:**
- Launched website on March 15
- First sale: March 18 (3 days later)
- Current revenue: ₦500k+/month

How? 

Simple: We built a site designed to convert.

Every button. Every form. Every page. Tested and optimized for sales.

---

**What they got:**
✅ Professional brand site (not a template)
✅ Contact forms + lead capture
✅ Mobile-perfect on every device
✅ SEO ready (ranks in Google within 60 days)
✅ Built-in Paystack checkout

**Time invested:** 14 days
**Cost:** ₦299,000 (one-time)
**Result after 6 months:** ₦2.3M revenue attributed to website

---

**The question for you:**
If you had a website making ₦500k+/month, would it change your business?

I'm betting yes.

### Why This Works
- Uses city name (personalization increases open rates 26%)
- Proof with numbers (₦500k = credible, specific)
- Social proof + authority + curiosity
- Multiple CTAs (link + reply option)

---

## Email 3: Objection Handler + Scarcity (Day 3)

### Subject Lines (Test A/B)
- A: "The thing everyone gets wrong about website costs"
- B: "Why ₦299,000 is the best deal you'll see"
- C: "Only 3 spots left this month"

### Body Template

```
Hi {FirstName},

I've heard a lot of objections over the years.

The most common? "That's expensive."

So let's talk about it.

---

**The math:**
- Agencies want ₦500k–₦1.5M for a website
- That ₦300k website sits on a server for 2 years
- That's ₦1.50/day in cost
- One customer on your site pays for it in an hour

**So really, the question isn't "Is ₦299,000 expensive?"**

The question is: "Can I afford NOT to have a website?"

For ₦299k, the answer is no. You can't afford not to.

---

**Here's what you're getting:**
✅ Custom design (not template)
✅ Mobile responsive (100% device coverage)
✅ SEO ready (Google search traffic)
✅ Paystack checkout (take payments immediately)
✅ 14-day launch (compete faster)
✅ Free hosting (first year included)
✅ Support (we're here if things break)

Plus: If you're not happy after 7 days, you get 50% back.

No questions asked.

---

**Real talk:** We're opening only 3 more spots this December.

After that, it's a 6-week wait until January.

If you want a website before year-end, now is the time.

[BUTTON: Reserve Your Spot]

Or reply: "Tell me more" and we'll book a call.

```

### Why This Works
- Addresses budget objection head-on (honesty builds trust)
- ROI framing (one customer pays for it)
- Scarcity (3 spots, 6-week wait) = urgency without being pushy
- Risk reversal (50% back guarantee) = removes risk

---

## Email 4: Case Study Deep Dive (Day 5)

### Subject Lines (Test A/B)
- A: "How {City} law firm got 50 new clients from website"
- B: "{FirstName}, this client's story might be yours"
- C: "From 0 to 50 clients: The website case study"

### Body Template

```
Hi {FirstName},

I want to walk you through one project from start to finish.

It's the kind of thing that gets me excited every time.

---

**CLIENT:** Law firm in {City}
**CHALLENGE:** No online presence. Losing clients to competitors with websites.
**GOAL:** 20+ qualified leads in first 3 months.

---

**What we built (14 days):**
✅ Professional law firm site (practice areas, attorney bios, testimonials)
✅ Contact form + lead capture
✅ SEO optimized for "{City} lawyer" search terms
✅ Client testimonial videos
✅ Mobile-perfect UX

**What happened:**

Month 1: 8 leads (mostly cold traffic)
Month 2: 22 leads (50% from Google organic search)
Month 3: 35 leads (Google now ranking #1 for "{City} lawyer")

Month 6 result: ₦4.2M revenue attributed to website

**Cost:** ₦299,000 (site) + ₦8,000/month maintenance
**ROI:** 14× return in 6 months

---

**Key lesson:** Your website isn't an expense. It's your best sales tool.

It works 24/7. No commission. No salary. Just results.

---

**Your turn:** What if we built the same for your business?

(We do web dev for law firms, agencies, e-commerce, coaches, consultants—you name it.)

```

### Why This Works
- Specific case study (law firm, {City}) = relatability
- Metrics + timeline (8→22→35 leads) = credible progression
- ROI math (14× return) = compelling value
- Removes last objection (investment pays for itself)

---

## Email 5: Final Offer + Decision Time (Day 7)

### Subject Lines (Test A/B)
- A: "Last chance: Website special ends tonight"
- B: "{FirstName}, the decision is yours"
- C: "Your website could go live by January 2"

## Email Personalization Variables

Use these in your email platform to auto-insert dynamic content:

```
{FirstName} = First name from form
{City} = City from landing page UTM
{Service} = Service type (web/marketing/ecom/plans/portfolio)
{CompetitorCount} = Number of competitors in their city with websites
{Price} = Service price (₦299k/300k/199k/25k)
{DaysSinceSignup} = Days since they opted in
{YourName} = Sender name
{CompanyName} = Hexadigitall
```

---

## Send Time Optimization

Test different send times per day:

| Email | Test A | Test B | Test C | Winner (track) |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|
| Day 0 | Immediate | — | — | Immediate (always) |
| Day 1 | 9 AM | 11 AM | 2 PM | Track opens |
| Day 3 | 10 AM | 2 PM | 6 PM | Track opens |
| Day 5 | 9 AM | 1 PM | 5 PM | Track opens |
| Day 7 | 11 AM | 3 PM | 7 PM | Track opens |

After 3 cycles, lock in highest open rate time and use it for all future sends.

---

## Subject Line Testing Framework

Test 2 subject lines per email (A/B split):

**Email 1 (Day 0):**
- A: "Your website is costing you money" (direct pain)
- B: "Quick question: does your website make sales?" (curious)
→ Winner: A/B = measure opens, pick winner, use for future web leads

**Email 2 (Day 1):**
- A: "One {City} client went from ₦0 to ₦500k/month" (specific proof)
- B: "{FirstName}, see what {City} businesses are doing" (personalization)
→ Winner: measure opens, lock in

**Continue pattern for Emails 3–5**

---

## Tracking & Optimization

### Metrics to Monitor
- **Open rate:** Target 25–35% (good = 30%)
- **Click rate:** Target 3–5% (good = 4%)
- **Reply rate:** Target 2–5% (shows interest)
- **Conversion to call:** Target 5–15% of opens

### A/B Testing Priority Order
1. Subject line (biggest impact on opens)
2. Send time (affects open rates)
3. Email copy (swap angles: pain → proof → urgency → offer)
4. CTA button text (clear action words)
5. From name (personalization improves opens 26%)

---

## Email Copy Tone & Style

**Always:**
- Write like a human (not corporate)
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Start with benefit (hook first sentence)
- Use specific numbers (₦500k, 14 days, 50 leads)
- End with clear CTA (reply, click button, or book call)

**Never:**
- ALL CAPS (unless emphasis on one word)
- 10+ paragraphs (wall of text = 0% opens)
- Vague CTAs ("Click here" vs. "Book free consultation")
- Multiple CTAs per email (one ask per email)

---

## Integration with Sales Pipeline

### Lead Scoring
Tag emails with:
- **Hot:** Opened 3+ emails, clicked 2+ links, replied to email
- **Warm:** Opened 2 emails, clicked 1 link
- **Cold:** Opened 0–1 emails

Route Hot leads to sales call immediately.
Route Warm leads to check-in email (Day 10).
Route Cold leads to re-engagement sequence (Day 14).

### From Email to Call
- Email 7 closes with: "Reply 'YES' or book here"
- If they reply: Sales team responds within 2 hours
- If they click: Calendar link opens (book 20-min consultation)
- If no response: Day 10 reminder email ("Still interested?")

---

- [ ] 3–5% avg click rate
- [ ] 5–10% conversion to consultation calls
