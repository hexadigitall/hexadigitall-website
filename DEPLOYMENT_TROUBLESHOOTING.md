# üö® Production Deployment Issue Analysis

## Issue: CMS-Driven Service Pages Not Working on Live Site

### ‚úÖ What Works:
- ‚úÖ Local development site shows all 5 services correctly
- ‚úÖ Code changes pushed to GitHub successfully
- ‚úÖ Sanity Studio populated with service data locally

### üîç Likely Issues:

## 1. **Missing Environment Variables on Vercel**
The live site probably doesn't have the required Sanity environment variables:

**Required Variables:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=puzezel0
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production  
SANITY_API_TOKEN=skUrug79C6GgpNjoSDGrQW3demI9zuFvpvsx975Meg3qxl1h9d70Rk2wxWIbnGnRbohHNmJfEvfQI1IE1ffowSaCRiVn82UYF7GYSsOCmOzH2AsKKxlTSsNAiX4OfKseFrfsB8y7hf4jbV8pbPzEcJ79gBr4VSQkH0DUnBNL0gIlF1euaeGZ
SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET=5u/XgPtEswqMDXhGg8cS4Q2h3TiPhF37mXDzeluwIjw=
```

## 2. **Service Data Only Exists Locally**
The migration script (`scripts/populate-sanity-services.js`) only ran locally. The production Sanity dataset might not have the 5 service categories.

## 3. **Build/Deployment Issues**
- Vercel might be failing to build with the new CMS dependencies
- Static generation might be failing due to missing Sanity data

---

## üîß **Immediate Fixes Needed:**

### **Fix 1: Add Environment Variables to Vercel**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add all the Sanity environment variables from `.env.local`
3. Redeploy the project

### **Fix 2: Run Production Migration** 
The service data needs to be created in the production Sanity dataset:
```bash
# This creates the services in production Sanity
SANITY_API_TOKEN="[production_token]" node scripts/populate-sanity-services.js
```

### **Fix 3: Check Vercel Build Logs**
Look for any build failures related to:
- Missing environment variables
- Sanity client connection issues  
- Static generation failures

---

## üéØ **Expected Result After Fixes:**
All 5 service pages should work on live site:
1. `/services/business-plan-and-logo-design` 
2. `/services/web-and-mobile-software-development`
3. `/services/social-media-marketing`
4. `/services/mentoring-and-consulting` 
5. `/services/profile-and-portfolio-building`
