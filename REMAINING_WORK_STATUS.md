### 2. **StartingAtPriceDisplay Implementation**

## ‚ùå Still Need To Complete:

### 1. **Fix Remaining Service Package Features**
- Marketing packages need complete rewrite with distinct features
- Consulting packages need complete rewrite with distinct features  
- Branding packages need complete rewrite with distinct features
- Portfolio packages need complete rewrite with distinct features

### 2. **Service Group Organization**
You requested specific grouping:
- **Web Development Group**: Landing Page, Business Website, E-commerce Store
- **Mobile App Development Group**: Simple Mobile App, Business App, Enterprise App  
- **Web & Mobile Combo Group**: Startup Combo, Business Combo, Enterprise Combo

**Current Issue**: These groups are not yet implemented in the UI

### 3. **Individual Services UI Access**
- Individual services ($49-$149) are defined but not accessible to users
- Need to add UI section/modal for budget options

### 4. **Apply Glassmorphism Across All Service Pages**
- Main services overview page still needs enhancement
- Individual service pages partially done (need JSX fix)

### 5. **Implement StartingAtPriceDisplay Everywhere**
- Replace fixed pricing displays across all components
- Currently only imported, not implemented

## üö® Critical Issues to Fix First:

### 1. **JSX Syntax Error**
File: `/src/app/services/[slug]/page.tsx`
- JSX structure broken causing build failure
- Need to fix tag alignment

### 2. **Missing Feature Differentiation**
- Many service tiers still have similar features despite different pricing
- Need complete rewrite of Marketing, Consulting, Branding, Portfolio packages

### 3. **Service Group Modal Integration**
- Components created but not integrated into service pages
- Need to replace current package displays with group-based system

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Fix JSX syntax error** to get build working
2. **Complete feature rewrite** for remaining service categories  
3. **Implement service group system** as requested
4. **Add individual services access** in UI
5. **Apply visual enhancements** to all service pages
6. **Replace all fixed pricing** with "Starting at..." displays

## ‚ú® Key Accomplishments So Far:
- **Web & Mobile packages** now have distinctly different, specific features
- **Individual micro-services** created for budget-conscious clients
- **Visual enhancement system** established with glassmorphism components
- **Pricing display system** created for "Starting at..." format
- **Service group modal system** built for better UX

**The foundation is solid - we just need to complete the integration and fix the remaining service categories.**
